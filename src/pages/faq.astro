                Fair Source is software sharing that is safe and fair for companies 
                and developers alike. The two basic features of Fair Source software 
                licensing are:

                    Developers are free to use the software internally without directly 
                    competing with the company behind it.

                    Fair Source software automatically becomes Open Source software, 
                    usually after two years.

                  Fair Source partially fulfills the purposes of the Open Source to “persuade organizations and software authors to distribute source software freely they otherwise would not distribute.” Fair Source provides as many of the benefits of Open Source to developers as companies are comfortable giving, while reserving and asserting a minimal set of exclusive rights to help achieve a sustainable business model.

              Fair Source provides developers with many of the benefits of Free and Open Source Software (FOSS).

              In terms of the four software freedoms, Fair Source provides the freedom to read, run for almost all purposes, modify, and contribute back to the production of the software.
            </p>
            <p class="mb-[2rem]">
              Additionally, Fair Source ensures (unlike Open Source) that the software is supported by a sustainable business model so that it can be continually maintained and improved. In the event that a Fair Source product is abandoned or developed in an unsatisfactory direction, new developers can fork a previous version.
