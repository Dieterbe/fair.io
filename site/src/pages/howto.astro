        <h2>
          Fair source is for companies that want to engage with the developer community
          in a meaningful way.
        </h2>
        <p>
          Don’t overplan but don’t underplan. You’re competing with a lot of others for 
          limited attention, so it’s likely that you won’t see a flood of engagement 
          at first. As your product gets traction so will your community, and vice 
          versa.

        <h2>Licensing is the heart of Fair Source</h2>
        <p>
          Our recommended approach is the Functional Source Licens 
          (filler spacee — a robust, clear, non-compete license that offers 
          two-year OSS conversion. FSL is ideal for companies with a SaaS business 
          model. If you have more complex requirements, consider using the 
          [ bdlank filler space, a hacky but works] instead. It is much more 
          flexible than FSL at the cost of simplicity and clarity.
